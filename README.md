# nuxt-boilerplate
> Starter template for Nuxt.js with Contentful CMS

## Description
This is a boilerplate for [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) and [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) CMS projects. In this project we focus on a headless solution with Contentful. If you prefer an other CMS, itâ€™s easy to integrate with this boilerplate.

## Project setup
Duplicate the `sample.env` file to `.env` and configure your projects environment variables if you are in development mode:

```
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
ENVIRONMENT=development
SITENAME=My awesome application
NPM_TOKEN=
```

## Build setup

``` bash
# Install your dependencies with yarn
$ yarn install

# run with yarn
$ yarn dev

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
